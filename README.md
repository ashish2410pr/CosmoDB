Prompt:

Create an Azure-based billing records archival system with the following requirements:

Core Functionality:
1.	Automatically archive billing records from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage when they're older than 90 days
2.	Use Azure Functions with Cosmos DB Change Feed trigger for real-time archival
3.	Organize archived files in blob storage as: billing/YYYY/MM/record-id.json
4.	Create an intelligent API that searches both active Cosmos DB and archived blob storage

Technical Stack:
1.	Azure Functions (Python) for serverless processing
2.	Cosmos DB for hot data storage
3.	Azure Blob Storage for cold data archival
4.	Terraform for infrastructure as code

Deliverables:
1.	Azure Function code with Change Feed trigger
2.	Terraform configuration for blob storage setup
3.	Enhanced API with fallback logic for record retrieval
4.	Comprehensive documentation and setup instructions
5.	Environment configuration examples
   
Additional Features:
1.	Hierarchical storage organization by year/month
2.	Optional cleanup of archived records from Cosmos DB
3.	Proper connection string management
4.	Infrastructure outputs for easy integration

Make the solution production-ready with proper error handling, monitoring capabilities, and security best practices.
After getting all these then refine and rephrase the content as per required.



Implementation of requirement
________________________________________
1. Trigger/ Azure function(Azure_function_init.py)
•	This trigger continuously monitors the records in Cosmos DB and identifies those older than 90 days.
________________________________________
3. Archiving Data to Blob Storage
•	When the trigger detects records exceeding the 90-day threshold, it initiates the archival process.
•	The identified records are extracted from Cosmos DB and moved to Azure Blob Storage, which is more cost-effective for storing large volumes of rarely accessed data.
________________________________________
4. Organizing Data in the Data Lake
•	Within Blob Storage, the archived records are saved as CSV or JSON files.
•	Files are systematically organized into folders by year and month, making it easy to locate and retrieve historical data as needed.
________________________________________
5. Data Retrieval(client_api_update.py)
•	When a record is requested, the system first checks Cosmos DB for recent data.
•	If the record is not found (because it’s older than 90 days), the system automatically looks for it in Blob Storage, retrieving it from the appropriate CSV/JSON file.
________________________________________
6. Infrastructure Setup(setup_Blobstorage.tf)
•	Azure resources such as Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, and Function Apps are provisioned, often using Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform for repeatability and automation.
•	Proper access controls and environment configurations are set to ensure secure and reliable operations.
